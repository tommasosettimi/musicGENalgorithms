Generative music and sound synthesis algorithms in SuperCollider and Python programming environments.

## Summary

This repository contains various **generative music** and **sound synthesis** algorithms in SuperCollider and Python programming environments. There are various folders, specifically: **generative_algorithm_1**, **generative_algorithm_2** (more folders will be uploaded in the next few days, likewise the documentation will be expanded). Each folder contains the respective SuperCollider (.scd) file and a small audio excerpt (.wav) file from the .scd file. 
The sound synthesis of the algorithms involves many techniques and processes of various kind, from classical techniques such as FM with feedback synthesis to dynamical systems of integrated differential equations. Since their nature is very singluar I preferred to heavily comment the code rather than a detailed description.
